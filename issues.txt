1.  The php code runs every time the form.php page loads which give "Undefine array key 'document' " error. 
    So, this block of code must be executed only if the request method is POST.
2.  The variable name $target_file makes diffrent sense. It should be $target_location.
3.  Undefined array key "fileToUpload" 
    move_uploaded_file( string $filename , string $destination ): bool
    The move_uploaded_file take two argument file name and destination. We know the file name is "document"
    $_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"] should be replaced by $_FILES["document"]["tmp_name"]
4.  move_uploaded_file(uploads/newplot.png): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory 
    we need to create the uploads inside current working directory.
5.  This code upload any type of file (ie. .jpg, .png, .pdf and so on)
    To restrict the user form uploading file other than .php we need to check if the extension of the file is .png or not.
